# MSP-EXP430FR5994 LM75A Temperature Sensor Project

This project demonstrates how to read temperature data from an **LM75A digital temperature sensor** via **I¬≤C** and display the readings on a computer screen via **UART**, using the **MSP-EXP430FR5994 LaunchPad**.  
The code is written in C and developed using **Code Composer Studio (CCS)**.

## üîß Description

The program communicates with the **LM75A** sensor using the **I¬≤C protocol** to read temperature measurements. These readings are then transmitted over **UART** to a PC for display.  

This project is useful for understanding:

- I¬≤C communication with sensors on MSP430  
- GPIO and peripheral setup on MSP430FR5994  
- UART transmission for monitoring and debugging
